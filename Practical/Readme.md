# ðŸ“Š Statistics and Data Analysis Practicals

Welcome to my repository dedicated to **Statistics and Data Analysis**!
This repository showcases my lab exercises, coursework, and mini-projects that demonstrate practical applications of statistical theory. Each practical explores real-world datasets through analytical and computational methods.

## ðŸ“˜ Practical Overview

All practicals are organized sequentially by number, with each folder containing the related scripts, reports, and datasets used for analysis.

---

## ðŸ§© Core Topics Explored

Over the course of these exercises, Iâ€™ve implemented and analyzed a wide range of statistical techniques, such as:

* Descriptive and Inferential Analysis
* Probability Theory and Random Variables
* Data Visualization (Bar Charts, Histograms, Scatterplots, etc.)
* Hypothesis Testing (t-tests, ANOVA, Chi-Square Tests)
* Correlation and Regression Models
* Estimation and Confidence Intervals

## ðŸ§° Tools and Technologies

All analyses have been performed using **Python**, leveraging the following key libraries:

* **pandas** â†’ Efficient data cleaning and transformation
* **NumPy** â†’ Core numerical computations
* **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** â†’ Visualizing data and trends
* **SciPy** â†’ Advanced statistical operations and hypothesis testing
* **scikit-learn** â†’ Machine learning algorithms and regression techniques
